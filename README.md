# RSINFS (RoSolder Is Not For Skids)

## Introduction
- RSINFS (RoSolder Is Not For Skids) is a for-fun project to attempt to modify the leaked SynapseX source code from 2019 to try and turn it into my own script executor.
- As the name suggests, it is not for skids (script kiddies). This executor will be strictly for debugging games and finding exploits in them, then reporting the found exploits to developers.

## What does the release contain?
- Moderately or heavily modified, complete source code of SynapseX. The modified source code will probably be bad, since I have to optimize them and stuff using ChatGPT coding bots.
- Numerous libraries that aids in developing SynapseX and associated products.
- The source code to several scripts available in the SynapseX script hub, excluding proprietary (paid) scripts.
- The complete source code to the user interfaces.
